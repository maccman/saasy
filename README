== Welcome to Saasy

Saasy is a Rails app that bills and authenticates, so you don't have to.
The idea is that you host Saasy on a subdomain, and communicate with it using SSO/REST protocols. 
That means you're free to do more interesting coding.

*At the moment this is alpha code - use at your own risk*

I'd like to thank Made by Many (http://madebymany.co.uk) for supporting this project.

== Gateways
  
Currently the following gateways are supported:
* Braintree
* TrustCommerce
* PaymentExpress

== Choosing a Gateway

Braintree seems to be a good choice, and they're friendly to Railers to:

== Test transactions

As far as I could tell, Braintree are the only Gateway that lets you
test transactions without signing up.

== SSO (single sign on)

I've implemented a simple SSO using shared secrets.
have a look at lib/sso.rb for more information.

== Gotchas

I've made some extensions to various plugins/libs which I've
yet to push back:

* Extended ActiveMerchant's Braintree and Trust Commerce gateways (see initializers)
* Edited acts_as_state_machine:
  * Added named_scope 'in_state'
  * Stopped it overriding any states I specified before creation
  * Make it update all the attributes on save, not just the state column
* Used the Rails 2.2 version of prawnto (http://github.com/filiptepper/prawnto/tree/master) 
* Edited ssl_requirement so that it's disabled in development/test mode.
* Rails error_messages_for now uses spans, instead of divs, to be standards compliant
* Add a float component to Prawn (see initializers)
